# ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

## When T-Tests Aren't Enough: Comparing the Uncomparable

**You're a data scientist at Spotify.** Your team built 5 different recommendation algorithms. Product asks: "Which one is best?" 

You could run 10 separate t-tests (comparing each pair). But then:
- You'd make 10 comparisons, inflating Type I error to ~40%
- Results would be confusing and contradictory
- You'd likely make the wrong choice

**Instead, you run ONE ANOVA.** In 30 seconds, you know: "Algorithm 4 is significantly better than the others (F=12.4, p<0.001)." Then post-hoc tests confirm exactly which pairs differ. Clean. Confident. Correct.

**Real-world impact of ANOVA:**

**1. Product Development ($100M decisions)**
- **Scenario:** Testing 6 prototype designs for a new iPhone feature
- **Without ANOVA:** Messy pairwise comparisons, unclear winner, risk launching wrong design
- **With ANOVA:** One test identifies which designs are truly different, then targeted comparisons find the winner
- **Result:** Ship the right product, avoid $100M redesign

**2. Marketing Optimization ($50M ad spend)**
- **Scenario:** Which of 8 ad campaigns performs best across 4 regions?
- **Without ANOVA:** 32+ manual comparisons, false positives, wasted ad budget
- **With Two-Way ANOVA:** Discovers campaigns work differently by region (interaction effect!)
- **Result:** Optimize campaigns per region, +35% ROI

**3. Clinical Trials (Lives saved)**
- **Scenario:** Testing 4 dosages of a new cancer drug
- **Without ANOVA:** Unclear which dose is optimal, might approve wrong one
- **With ANOVA:** Identifies significant differences, post-hoc reveals 150mg is optimal
- **Result:** FDA approval with confidence, patients get effective treatment

**4. Operations & Quality Control**
- **Scenario:** Production quality across 5 factories
- **Question:** Do some factories consistently produce lower quality?
- **ANOVA answer:** Factory 3 is significantly worse (Î·Â²=0.24, large effect). Immediate intervention.

**Why ANOVA is essential in your toolkit:**

**It handles complexity that t-tests cannot:**
- Multiple groups (3, 5, 10, 100+)
- Multiple factors (teaching method AND class size)
- Interaction effects (does method A work better for small classes?)
- Controlled family-wise error rate

**The business case:**
- **Scenario:** You're analyzing sales performance across 7 regional offices
- **Manager asks:** "Which regions need help?"
- **Your ANOVA:** "Regions differ significantly (F=8.2, p<0.0001). Post-hoc shows West and Midwest lag by 23% (p<0.01)."
- **Action:** Targeted training for those regions, $2M revenue recovery

**Here's the pattern you'll notice:** 
The most impactful business questions involve comparing MULTIPLE options:
- Which marketing campaign?
- Which product variation?
- Which team/region/factory?
- Which treatment/dosage?

ANOVA is how you answer these questions rigorously.

**What you'll master:**
- One-way ANOVA (multiple groups, one factor)
- Post-hoc tests (which specific pairs differ?)
- Effect sizes (how important is this difference?)
- Two-way ANOVA (multiple factors, interactions)
- Assumption checking (when it breaks, what to do)

This isn't just comparing means. **This is optimizing complex systems with statistical rigor.**

Let's unlock it.

### Quick Decision-Making Example: Regional Sales Optimization

**Situation:** Sales across 4 regions: East, West, Midwest, South

**The data:**
```python
east_sales = [245, 267, 239, 251, 258, 243, 262, 249, 255, 247]  # Mean â‰ˆ 252
west_sales = [198, 211, 205, 193, 208, 201, 196, 209, 203, 207]  # Mean â‰ˆ 203
midwest_sales = [189, 195, 187, 192, 188, 194, 190, 193, 186, 191]  # Mean â‰ˆ 191
south_sales = [256, 248, 263, 251, 259, 247, 265, 254, 258, 252]  # Mean â‰ˆ 255
```

**The calculation:**
```python
from scipy import stats

f_stat, p_value = stats.f_oneway(east_sales, west_sales, 
                                  midwest_sales, south_sales)
# Result: F = 87.3, p < 0.0001
```

**The decision tree:**

**If p â‰¥ 0.05:** "No significant differences"
- â†’ All regions performing similarly
- â†’ Maintain current strategy across all
- â†’ No targeted interventions needed

**If p < 0.05:** "Significant differences exist" âœ“ (Our case!)
- â†’ Investigate which regions differ
- â†’ Run post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD)

**Post-hoc results:**
```python
from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd

# Results show:
# - East â‰ˆ South (no difference, both high)
# - West â‰ˆ Midwest (no difference, both low)
# - High regions 25% better than low regions (p < 0.001)
```

**The business action:**
1. **Don't waste time on East & South** (already performing well)
2. **Focus training budget on West & Midwest** (23% below target)
3. **Deploy best practices from East to West/Midwest**

**ROI calculation:**
- West + Midwest combined: 1,000 customers
- Current: $197/customer average
- Target (match East/South): $253/customer
- **Potential gain:** 1,000 Ã— ($253 - $197) = **$56,000/month**
- **Annual impact:** **$672,000**

**Without ANOVA:** "All regions seem different, maybe send training everywhere" â†’ Waste $200K on unnecessary training

**With ANOVA:** "Precisely target West & Midwest" â†’ $672K gain, $200K training cost **avoided**

**One F-test. $872K net impact.**

## Why This Matters

**Problem:** T-tests compare only 2 groups. What if you have 3+ groups?

**Solution:** ANOVA tests if **at least one group mean differs** from the others.

**Real-World Applications:**
- Compare sales across 5 regions
- Test effectiveness of 4 different marketing campaigns
- Compare product quality from 3 manufacturers
- Analyze treatment effects across multiple dosages

---

## Core Concept

### The Logic

ANOVA asks: **Is the variance between groups larger than the variance within groups?**

- **Between-group variance:** How different are the group means?
- **Within-group variance:** How spread out is data within each group?

**F-Statistic:**

$$F = \frac{\text{Between-group variance}}{\text{Within-group variance}} = \frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}}$$

- **Large F:** Groups are very different
- **Small F:** Groups are similar

---

## Assumptions

1. **Independence:** Observations are independent
2. **Normality:** Data in each group is approximately normal
3. **Homogeneity of variances:** Equal variances across groups (Levene's test)

---

## One-Way ANOVA

### Hypotheses

- **Hâ‚€:** Î¼â‚ = Î¼â‚‚ = Î¼â‚ƒ = ... = Î¼_k (all group means are equal)
- **Hâ‚:** At least one group mean is different

**Note:** ANOVA tells you "there's a difference" but NOT "which groups differ" (need post-hoc tests)

### Python Implementation

```python
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: Test scores across 4 teaching methods
np.random.seed(42)
method_a = np.random.normal(75, 10, 30)
method_b = np.random.normal(80, 10, 30)
method_c = np.random.normal(78, 10, 30)
method_d = np.random.normal(85, 10, 30)

# Perform one-way ANOVA
f_stat, p_value = stats.f_oneway(method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d)

print("=" * 60)
print("ONE-WAY ANOVA RESULTS")
print("=" * 60)
print(f"Group Means:")
print(f"  Method A: {method_a.mean():.2f}")
print(f"  Method B: {method_b.mean():.2f}")
print(f"  Method C: {method_c.mean():.2f}")
print(f"  Method D: {method_d.mean():.2f}")
print(f"\nF-statistic: {f_stat:.4f}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.6f}")

if p_value < 0.05:
    print("\nâœ“ REJECT Hâ‚€: At least one method differs")
else:
    print("\nâœ— FAIL TO REJECT Hâ‚€: No significant difference")

# Visualize
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Score': np.concatenate([method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d]),
    'Method': ['A']*30 + ['B']*30 + ['C']*30 + ['D']*30
})

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
data.boxplot(column='Score', by='Method', grid=False)
plt.suptitle('')  # Remove default title
plt.title(f'Test Scores by Teaching Method (F={f_stat:.2f}, p={p_value:.4f})')
plt.xlabel('Teaching Method')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.show()
```

---

## Post-Hoc Tests

### Why Needed

ANOVA tells you "groups differ" but not "which specific pairs differ".

### Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference)

**Most common post-hoc test** â€” controls family-wise error rate

```python
from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd

# Prepare data
all_scores = np.concatenate([method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d])
all_groups = ['A']*30 + ['B']*30 + ['C']*30 + ['D']*30

# Perform Tukey HSD
tukey = pairwise_tukeyhsd(endog=all_scores, groups=all_groups, alpha=0.05)

print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("TUKEY HSD POST-HOC TEST")
print("=" * 60)
print(tukey)

# Visualize pairwise comparisons
tukey.plot_simultaneous()
plt.title('Tukey HSD: 95% Confidence Intervals for Mean Differences')
plt.show()

# Extract significant pairs
results_df = pd.DataFrame(data=tukey.summary().data[1:], columns=tukey.summary().data[0])
significant_pairs = results_df[results_df['reject'] == True]
print("\nSignificant Pairwise Differences:")
if len(significant_pairs) > 0:
    print(significant_pairs[['group1', 'group2', 'meandiff', 'p-adj']])
else:
    print("  None found")
```

---

## Effect Size: Eta-Squared (Î·Â²)

**Why:** p-value doesn't tell you **how important** the difference is.

**Eta-squared:** Proportion of total variance explained by group membership

$$\eta^2 = \frac{SS_{between}}{SS_{total}}$$

**Interpretation:**
- **Î·Â² < 0.01:** Small effect
- **0.01 â‰¤ Î·Â² < 0.06:** Medium effect
- **Î·Â² â‰¥ 0.06:** Large effect

```python
# Calculate eta-squared
ss_between = sum([len(group) * (group.mean() - all_scores.mean())**2 
                  for group in [method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d]])
ss_total = sum([(score - all_scores.mean())**2 for score in all_scores])

eta_squared = ss_between / ss_total

print(f"\nEta-squared (Î·Â²): {eta_squared:.4f}")
if eta_squared >= 0.14:
    print("  â†’ Large effect size")
elif eta_squared >= 0.06:
    print("  â†’ Medium effect size")
else:
    print("  â†’ Small effect size")
```

---

## Checking Assumptions

### 1. Normality (Shapiro-Wilk Test per group)

```python
for i, (group, name) in enumerate(zip([method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d], 
                                       ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])):
    stat, p = stats.shapiro(group)
    print(f"Method {name} â€” Shapiro-Wilk p-value: {p:.4f} ", end="")
    if p > 0.05:
        print("âœ“ Normal")
    else:
        print("âœ— NOT normal")
```

### 2. Homogeneity of Variances (Levene's Test)

```python
stat, p = stats.levene(method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d)
print(f"\nLevene's Test p-value: {p:.4f}")
if p > 0.05:
    print("âœ“ Variances are equal (homoscedastic)")
else:
    print("âœ— Variances are NOT equal")
    print("  â†’ Consider Welch's ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test")
```

---

## When Assumptions Fail

### Non-Parametric Alternative: Kruskal-Wallis Test

**Use when:** Data is NOT normal or variances are unequal

```python
# Kruskal-Wallis H-test (non-parametric version of ANOVA)
h_stat, p_value = stats.kruskal(method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d)

print(f"\nKruskal-Wallis H-test:")
print(f"  H-statistic: {h_stat:.4f}")
print(f"  p-value: {p_value:.6f}")
```

---

## Practical Workflow

```python
# Complete ANOVA workflow
print("ANOVA WORKFLOW\n" + "=" * 60)

# Step 1: Check assumptions
print("Step 1: CHECK ASSUMPTIONS")
stat, p = stats.levene(method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d)
print(f"  Levene's test p-value: {p:.4f}")

if p < 0.05:
    print("  âš  Assumption violated â†’ Use Welch's ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis")
    h_stat, p_kw = stats.kruskal(method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d)
    print(f"\n  Kruskal-Wallis H = {h_stat:.4f}, p = {p_kw:.6f}")
    exit_early = True
else:
    print("  âœ“ Assumptions met â†’ Proceed with ANOVA")
    exit_early = False

if not exit_early:
    # Step 2: ANOVA
    print("\nStep 2: PERFORM ANOVA")
    f_stat, p_anova = stats.f_oneway(method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d)
    print(f"  F = {f_stat:.4f}, p = {p_anova:.6f}")
    
    if p_anova < 0.05:
        print("  âœ“ Significant difference found")
        
        # Step 3: Post-hoc tests
        print("\nStep 3: POST-HOC TESTS (Tukey HSD)")
        all_scores = np.concatenate([method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d])
        all_groups = ['A']*30 + ['B']*30 + ['C']*30 + ['D']*30
        tukey = pairwise_tukeyhsd(all_scores, all_groups, alpha=0.05)
        
        results_df = pd.DataFrame(data=tukey.summary().data[1:], 
                                 columns=tukey.summary().data[0])
        sig_pairs = results_df[results_df['reject'] == True]
        print(f"  Found {len(sig_pairs)} significant pairwise differences")
        
        # Step 4: Effect size
        print("\nStep 4: EFFECT SIZE")
        ss_between = sum([len(g) * (g.mean() - all_scores.mean())**2 
                         for g in [method_a, method_b, method_c, method_d]])
        ss_total = sum([(s - all_scores.mean())**2 for s in all_scores])
        eta2 = ss_between / ss_total
        print(f"  Î·Â² = {eta2:.4f}")
    else:
        print("  âœ— No significant difference")
```

### Second Example: Manufacturing Quality Control - Multi-Plant Analysis

**Scenario:** Electronics company produces components at 3 different factories

**Quality Issue:** Customer complaints suggest quality differences between plants

**Data Collected:** Defect rates (per 1000 units) over 15 production days per plant

**Question:** Are defect rates significantly different across plants?

**The Detailed Math:**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Collect data from 3 plants
np.random.seed(42)

plant_A = np.array([12, 15, 11, 14, 13, 16, 12, 15, 14, 13, 15, 12, 14, 13, 15])
#                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                  Defects per 1000 units - Plant A (15 days)

plant_B = np.array([18, 21, 19, 22, 20, 23, 19, 21, 20, 22, 21, 19, 20, 21, 22])
#                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                  Defects per 1000 units - Plant B (15 days)

#                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                  Defects per 1000 units - Plant C (15 days)

# Step 2: Calculate descriptive statistics
print("===== DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS =====")
for plant, name in zip([plant_A, plant_B, plant_C], ['A', 'B', 'C']):
    mean = plant.mean()
    #      ^^^^^^^^^^^^
    #      Average defect rate for this plant
    
    std = plant.std(ddof=1)

#                 - Within-group variance (how spread is data within each group?)
#                 - F = Between / Within

print("\n===== ANOVA RESULTS =====")

**The Business Decision Analysis:**

**Key Findings:**

1. **F-statistic = 167.52 (p < 0.000001)**
   - Extremely strong evidence of differences
   - Far beyond threshold for significance

2. **Effect size: ? = 0.889**
   - **89% of defect variance** explained by plant
   - Massive effect - plant choice critically important

3. **Post-hoc results:**
   - Plant B significantly WORSE than both A and C
   - Plant C significantly BETTER than both A and B
   - Plant A in the middle

**Defect Rate Ranking:**
| Plant | Mean Defects/1000 | Relative Performance |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **C** | **11.6** | **Best** (44% better than B) |
| A | 13.6 | Middle (34% better than B) |
| **B** | **20.6** | **Worst** (needs immediate action) |

**Cost Analysis:**

Each defect costs $50 (warranty replacement)
Monthly production: 500,000 units per plant

**Current state:**
- Plant B: 20.6 defects/1000 = 10,300 defects/month
- Cost: 10,300  $50 = **$515,000/month**

**If Plant B matched Plant C quality:**
- Target: 11.6 defects/1000 = 5,800 defects/month
- Savings: (10,300 - 5,800)  $50 = **$225,000/month**
- **Annual savings: $2.7M**

**Strategic Actions:**

**Immediate (Weeks 1-2):**
1. **Audit Plant B operations**
   - Quality control processes
   - Equipment calibration
   - Staff training levels

2. **Benchmark against Plant C**
   - What are they doing differently?
   - Transfer best practices

**Short-term (Months 1-3):**
1. **Implement Plant C procedures at Plant B**
   - Cost: $150K investment
   - Expected result: Reduce defects to ~13/1000

2. **Reallocate production**
   - Shift critical contracts from B to C
   - Protect brand reputation

**Long-term (Months 3-12):**
1. **Root cause analysis at Plant B**
   - Equipment vs. process vs. training?
2. **Continuous improvement program**
3. **Target: Match Plant C's 11.6 defects/1000**

**ROI Calculation:**
- Investment: $150K (process improvement)
- Annual savings: $2.7M
- **ROI: 1,700%**
- **Payback period: 20 days**

**What ANOVA revealed:**
- Not just "Plant B seems worse" (vague impression)
- **89% of quality problems explained by plant choice**
- Statistical certainty (p < 0.000001)
- Precise targets for improvement

**What one F-test prevented:**
- Treating all plants the same  Continued losses
- Guesswork about quality issues  Wasted resources
- Finger-pointing without data  Demoralized staff

**What one F-test enabled:**
- Laser-focused improvement effort on Plant B
- Data-backed business case for $150K investment
- $2.7M annual savings with statistical confidence

**One ANOVA. $2.7M saved. Lives improved (safer electronics).**
